## Description

The EVE Online Overview Generator facilitates creating and maintaining overview packs.

The overviews are created out of game by editing YAML files
and then running a Ruby script to compile the overview files for import into the EVE client.

Rather then a single YAML file per overview, the various overview settings are split
into many files which can be reused to create custom overviews
based on a set of common groups, presets, settings, etc.

Essentially, you define a common set of LEGO bricks and build your overviews with them.

This README is intended primarily for developers and contributors.
